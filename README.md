## Contribution ##

This module started as a simple CSS file of tweaks that quickly got way out of hand. :( There is plenty of room for improvement if you felt inclined to do so!

## To Do ##

* Skin the ugly TinyMCE popups.
* Greatly improve CSS, switch to Sass/LESS?
* Change to using SVG icons for page types?
* Replace a few more bitmap icons, e.g. search icon in dropdowns, GridField sorting icons, AssetAdmin icons, and permissions icons for Members.
